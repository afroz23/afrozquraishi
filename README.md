# Hi, There! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagarchoudhary96/sagarchoudhary96/main/icons/wave.gif" width="30px">

This is my `personal website` , created with Next.js.

## What I have learned while creating this

-   ReactJs concepts like state, map, reuse components.
-   Managing all the components with one CSS file.
-   CSS concepts like selector, hover, Flexbox. Flexbox was very helpful to create responsiveness in the website.
