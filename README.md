# Hi, There! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sagarchoudhary96/sagarchoudhary96/main/icons/wave.gif" width="30px">
This is my `personal website` , created with ReactJs.

## What I have learned while creating this
- ReactJs concepts like state, map, reuse components.
- Managing all the components with one CSS file.
- CSS concepts like selector, Flexbox and Grid. Flexbox was very helpful to create responsiveness in the website.
